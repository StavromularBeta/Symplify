Symplify

Symplify is a python library designed to work with the Symbiot workstation. It is coupled to a novel workstation setup and also requires the use of the PE Biosystems software. It allows you to make methods much faster than you could with the original software - allowing the user to bypass the original routine builder.

To access the documentation, open QuickDocs.html in an internet browser of your choice. You can also access the documentation of any folder or file (if it exists) by entering 'pydoc (name of file or folder)' into the terminal.

you can access the latest version of the project (and all previous versions) at:

the LaserBlueprints folder contains .svg files that can be read by a laser printer to create custom holders for Symbiot.

SampleMethod.py contains an example of a working method.

This software was written by Peter Levett, an undergraduate student with the Hore Group, University of Victoria, Canada.
