This is the readme for Symplify. It is incoherent.

the Symbiot sample workstation is specifically designed to accelerate mass spectroscopy.
the goal of Symplify is to create software that makes deviations from the intended use of the machine easier.
the general idea is to
    understand the components and capabilities of the system
    use the components and capabilities in novel ways

the first version of Symplify aims to develop a system where liquid can be taken from one or two resevoirs and
injected into 96-well sample plates in identical, incremental, or specific amounts multiple times.

Symbiot reads some file.TLL when writing and editing methods and tests. Those files, when opened up as plaintext,
are essentially combinations of numbers and words separated by semicolons that signify different options that pop up
as you create/edit a method/test.

each group has tests, which have Steps. In these steps, there are commands that make the arm do things.

G;1;Sample and Matrix;1;0;65;
Group;GroupNumber;GroupTitle;MaxTestsPerPlate;OutputFormats;OptimizingMode;

This is the first line in a group.

G specifies that this line is a group
The groupNumber is the group number, 1 being the first group in the file
the GroupTitle is the name of the group
these variables are accessed by double clicking on "group" in the GUI, and refer to
various options/boxes/text inputs in said menus.

max tests per plate = 1
Output Formats - none are checked at 0
numbers don't correspond to anything in particular, for example 11 is the first three
checked and 15 is the first four checked. There are 8 options.
the last number in the sequence refers to the optimizing mode. Don't really know what
any of these actually are.

The W values
W values refer to the type of Step being added.
Pre Reagent = 256, Control(Before Samples) = Unknown(possibly 521), Sample = 1024,
EndControl(After Samples) = Unknown(possibly 2048), Post Reagent = 4096

#T;101;Sample(SP)/Matrix(SP);0;0;0;;MALDI 10x10 on row 16;
#Test;TestNumber;TestName;MaxTime;Unknown;Utilization;PredilutionRack(optional);DestinationRack;

this is the second line in a group, and it defines a test.

G;1;Sample and Matrix;1;0;65;
T;101;Sample(SP)/Matrix(SP);0;0;0;;MALDI 10x10 on row 16;
W;1024;
S;;1.000; - dunno yet. Always after every W command, always this line.

next comes C;1.00;1;SAMPLE;262210;0;0;0;2;0;0;
		   #Command;Volume;LocationModifier;Location;Unknown;Unknown;Unknown;Unknown;LiquidClass(Dropdown);Unknown;Unknown;

This line refers to the Draw step.
for the unknown 6 digit number, the last two digits are 10 if single pipetting, 9 for multi
C is command, or something similar.

C;1.00;4;;262170;0;0;0;1;1;0;
Command;Volume;LocationModifier;Location;Unknown;Unknown;Unknown;Unknown;LiquidClass(Dropdown);Unknown;Unknown

This line refers to the Drop & DITI step

The second two values are pairs corresponding to different selections of Location.
1;sample; = sample
4;; = Dest. Rack
8;ReagentName; = Reagent (Reagent name is selected from a dropdown list).
16;; = Waste.
